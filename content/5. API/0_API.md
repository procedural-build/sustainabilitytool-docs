# API Documentation

The Sustainability Tool has an extensive API that allows you to:
* Access all features of the tool programatically
* Integrate the tool with other business tools and workflows
* Automate reporting into the tool from other systems or IoT devices

## Documentation

The complete OpenAPI documentation may be accessed here in Swagger and Redoc respectively:
• Swagger: <https://uk.sustainabilitytool.com/api-docs/swagger/>
• ReDoc: <https://uk.sustainabilitytool.com/api-docs/redoc/>

Note also that the API documentation is interactive and requests may be made through the Swagger documentation or directly at the API endpoints if viewed using
HTTP methods such as a typical endpoint here: <https://uk.sustainabilitytool.com/api/project/>

*Note*: In order to interactively use the API then please ensure that you login to the _Swagger_ documentation page first to obtain a cookie which you may then use to access full documentation on _Redoc_ or make use of the interactive API endpoints. The interactive API uses a cookie-based authentication that is different from the authentication of the main website - so logging in to the main site will not work.

## Exmple Jupyter Notebook

An example Jupyter (Python) Notebook outlining an example scenario for reporting into the tool programatically may be
